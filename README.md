# SpeedWriterGame
- Hello, This is a small game called speed writer.
- First the player need to select their level and then type the words according to their level in given time frame.
- I used Javascript concepts like DOM manipulation, Event Listeners, etc. 
- I haven't styled it yet, but I am going to do that soon...
